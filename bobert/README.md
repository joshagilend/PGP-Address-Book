Bobert

- Bobert is a legend in his own unique way. We named our band in high school after his last name, and he was a great guitarist in the band. He knew my sister, her friends, and many of the people that came to be my close confidantes in high school and college. He went to college early, and had a great education. He worked his way up from an intern to become the leader of a team at a social media tech company, and I always turn to him when I have a question about code or systems design. He is fit and healthy, and has a great sense of humor, sarcastic and witty, and he loves finding trendy spots to eat; he has a knack for finding these spots which are just, extraordinary, and uncommon.
- He's close to his family. He cares about his parents, he cares about his sibling, and he knows that's he's the best in the west at AI research. He wants to meet someone from another place, and build a family. He's a good guy, ring that bell. üîî

Very Short Summary
30 / M / Berkeley _Los Angeles too_
A Little Less Short
EA Cause Area: X-risk
Occupation: Software Engineer _Team lead, I might add_
Orientation: Straight / Monogamous
Personality: Most comfortable in groups of 2 - 6, care a lot about those things that I focus on (ethics and aesthetics both); have sometimes been called a snob (affectionately).  I like to share my joy in food with friends & partners, and figure out what they like well enough to remove the need for them to exert any sort of mental effort on making decisions in that domain if they want.  (Food is not the only thing, just a good example of how I relate to people.) _Dry, sarcastic humor and really cares about people. I would say he would be my pick for a desert island buddy üèùÔ∏è_

What I‚Äôm Looking For
Personality:
Despite my archetype (high-decoupling nerd male software engineer), most of my closest friendships rest more on personality fit and mutual openness + support, rather than shared careers, interests, or hobbies (excepting rationalism).  Which is to say I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time talking about software or x-risk with friends when off the clock.  (There is some food, I‚Äôll admit.)  I probably would not have predicted those particular friendships ahead of time. _Translation: open for business :)_

In retrospect, important components have been:
Ability and willingness to discriminate between factual disagreements and values differences.  See: high-decoupling.
At the same time, not being strongly focused on contentious but intractable domains, like mainstream politics
Having an even temper.  Many other personality traits have been highly variable; e.g. I have quite a bit of practice supporting people through bouts of imposter syndrome.
Actually deeply giving a shit about something.  I‚Äôm not sure if this is causal but it sure has been a common thread.  That something is not always something I personally care about a ton, but it‚Äôs generally intelligible to me.  Examples: the flourishing of the local community one grew up in, exploring the limits of communication styles & bandwidth for another‚Ä¶

Socialization:
I like small things more than big things.  My tolerance for size increases when I know more of the people.  Quieter is better than louder.  Unstructured is better than structured - I‚Äôm not big on board games or movie nights (üò¨) but do like spontaneously-occurring pockets of discussion.  These are derived from how I‚Äôve felt across many different events, activities, and relationships, and exceptions certainly exist.  Of course, the kind of relationship I expect to be healthy anticipates occasions where we meet halfway and and those were we fly solo, depending on context.

I am basically happy to pack my calendar full of socialization, obligations permitting - I‚Äôve yet to run into situations where I was turning down opportunities to socialize because I‚Äôd had enough rather than because I didn‚Äôt have the time, or because I didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy myself doing that particular thing.  However, I wouldn‚Äôt feel particularly bereft if I spent a week at home, if I was doing something useful with that time.

Children:
At least one, and would want to see how the first one goes before deciding on more.  Pessimistic about traditional education, mostly due to personal experience, and would pretty strongly prefer defaulting to homeschooling or thoughtful co-op arrangements.  Ultimately, though, would want to defer to whatever actually worked best for the kid, as the person with the most introspective access relevant to the situation. _He wants two kids, like everyone else_

Maintenance:
I take care of myself reasonably well and happily outsource other things (e.g. house cleaning).  I do have aesthetic preferences about my living spaces but put a pretty heavy penalty on things that add significant overhead in terms of time and attention.  I find doing tasks in this category much easier with another person than doing them alone, but don‚Äôt want to over-promise.
Interesting things I‚Äôve done (or have happened to me):
I wrote the first long-form HP/f!TMR fanfic (it‚Äôs not actually great, but it is completed)
Got as far as ‚Äúfinished MVP and launched‚Äù with a startup while working full-time (sales?  what‚Äôre those?)
Have been stung by jellyfish three (3) times and lived to tell the tale
No longer keep track of how many times someone has said "this is the best thing I've ever tasted" or similar after taking them somewhere new
Speak mother tongue near fluently (—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π)
Flexible enough to do things too disturbing impressive to be accurately described by the written word

Hobbies (and how to get to know me):
Run LA rat meetup (I don‚Äôt tweet much, but searching the Discord server for my chat history is an ok substitute) _He did it at my house in LA! No credit, the shame ;)_
Help people get better jobs (mostly software) _He got my job. Winner üéØ_
Food (my FTC profile, for my writing in a totally different social context) _that pasta spot, wow ü§©_
Piano (ish) _Fruityloops. Ask him about fruityloops. That's a conversation starter, for sure_
Ballroom dance (recently restarted, looking for a partner) _dance is fun_
Choir (new, though I‚Äôve been into karaoke for a while) _I saw him sing, and it was fun. He is good! Singing is fun :) maybe the kids will do it_
